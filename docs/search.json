    "text": "Conclusion\nIn conclusion, while the analysis team depth using basic statistics did not show significant difference between the team depth of champion and non-champion teams, analysis using both advanced approach and combo approach showed that the championship winning teams have significantly higher team depth than non-champion teams. Since the quantification of team depth is specifically tuned to NBA statistics, the results are not generalizable to other leagues. If The NBA season is not independent of each other because players play for the same team across multiple seasons, this means that our result can only be applicable to our dataset or similar dataset for the play-off from 1990 to 2021.\nThe advanced team depth showed the greatest sample difference of 0.245 with p value < 0.001. This is the quantification of team depth with the most significant difference between championship and non-championship teams. We used the advanced team depth as an input to predict the championship outcome of the teams. The model successfully captured the trend that lower team depth means higher probability of not winning the championship."
